	Orignally planned to start with QT, build it all together, but QT has gotten quite annoying, I'll build logic
	side of it all first as a console app here in visual studio. I can see why a lot of devs skip out on UI and just do it all on 
	a console. UI still really good for users though, so once I'm done with logic i'll learn Qt and port it over.

	Anyways, desciption of the application here, what I plan to do:

		App where you throw a single txt file at it, and it pumps out a list of the highest frequency words.
		My use case? feed it speaclized content, for language learning, you'll get the vocab that is actually used frequently in whatever niche.

	How will I get there?

		txtfile -> mecab -> formatedtxtfile -> hash map -> vector -> sorting alg -> print vector to txt file

	I got MeCab up and running somehow, I think it works, displays incorrectly in local Visual Studio terminal, been really annoying to set up
	but hopefully it gets smoother with time. I don't really know what I'm doing as I set up this file to work here, I'll
	look deeper at the why later on, for now, I just want to get this app up and running.

	These file types, linking, directories, headers, how they all connect, and file location of all these, I set up paths, still all abstracted from
	me, I have no idea what I was doing. Question to answer later on, what is a dll file, a lib file. Libraries are a lot more involved here in
	c++ compared to python. 

	I'm going crazy,a ,aihjkh wgy wont it work, kasdjfl;kasl;kfsajfasjkl;fasdj;klfasj;lkfsajk;lfasd;kojl i cant imagien trying to do this ebfore ai, 
	iasiadfjsdfikjm ,, just trying to get MeCab up and running, what the heckae... 

	I hate this, I hate this so much, I got it wokring... more like my good pal chatgpt got it up and running, not perfectly, but we got enough to keep
	the app going, I need to learn more about how txt gets encoded, are all libraries really going to be like this, a lot of documenatation behind MeCab
	might be in japanese, i have no clue, for now, the app lives on, we move forward.

	Basically done with the logic side of the app, just have to organize and connect it all. Once I get a terminal ui and testing done, 
	i'll go back to QT and create a proper ui. 

	Working on this instead of studying for finals... I did so bad in classes this semester. 
	I'll make up for it by coding a lot during this winter break.
